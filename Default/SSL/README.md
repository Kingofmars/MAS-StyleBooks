# SSL Offload and Ciphers/Profiles #
This folder contains StyleBooks for SSL feature such as building NetScaler certkeys from certificate/key files, and creating SSL Ciphers and Profiles. The main StyleBook is ssl-config.yaml, while the StyleBook certkeys-v11.yaml builds CertKeys and the file vserver-certs-binds-v11.yaml binds them to an SSL VServer (see the cs-lb-mon-full StyleBook in SampleApps folder as an example of how these StyleBooks are used when building a StyleBook for an Application).
