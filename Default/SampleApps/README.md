This Folder contains 2 Sample Application StyleBooks:
  * Sample CS App: This shows a very simple CS StyleBook (with very simple UI/Parameters) that is built on top of the generic contentswitching StyleBook (cs-lb-mon)
  * Complex CS App: This shows a StyleBook for an App that is also built on top of the generic contentswitching StyleBook (cs-lb-mon) but also on other StyleBooks for Compression, Caching, Rewrite, Responder, SSL, etc. The purpose of this StyleBook is to show how one can make use of the feature-specific StyleBooks in building an Application StyleBook
  * Complex LB App: This is similar to the Complex CS App, but is instead based on the loadbalancing StyleBook (lb-mon) as there is no ContentSwitching needed in this case.
